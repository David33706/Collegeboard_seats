Non-profit telegram bot application that helps people to check the SAT seat availability

I have developed this bot to help people from Post-soviet countried including Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrygyzstan for registering to SAT. The bot checks every 3 minutes the aviability of SAT seat in August, October, and December. 
Since the issue with registration have resolved, the bot is currently deactivated and the code with files isn't updated for the new dates. If you are interested, you may modify technical aspects of the application and activate it again.

# Technical aspects
The code is adapted for Linux systems
Modify the path for Chromedriver accordingly
Make sure to put your Telegram bot's TOKEN in ".env" located in "aiogram-bot-template-master" folder
File "main.db" will be automatically created after bot activation and serves as the database of users
